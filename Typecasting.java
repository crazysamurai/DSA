/*
 * Changing datatype - typecasting
 * smaller datatype to a larger datatype - widening typecasting - Automatically
 * done by java
 * Explicit typecasting:
 * long x = 10000;
 * int l = x; //wrong
 * int l = (int)x; //correct
 * 
 * Lossy conversion: if the type into which we are converting has smaller range
 * than the original datatype
